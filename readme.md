#### Description

Multim0d is a script sequencer that was written for the now-closed [Metaplace][metaplace] virtual world and game platform. This tool allowed compatible effects modules to be configured and run via a playlist, with optional looping and pre/post behaviors. An open API allowed anyone to create compatible effects. 

Also included here are several plugin effects modules: RingFlow, Quake Tiles, Fill Tiles, Dramatic Spawner and Random Tiles. 


#### About

Multim0d and the various plugins were orignially sold on the the Metaplace market, but are now released under the BSD 3-clause license.

The source is Lua (with Metaplace extensions) and the documentation was generated with [Locco][locco].
